<h1>Professional_Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Professional Portfolio to highlight work and developer experiences.</h2>

This is a project to showcase my professional resume and portfolio. It has a 
simple introduction at the top, and dynamically accessible sections towards the
bottom to allow the user to open up additional content as he/she may choose. 

A background spans the entire width of the page, including transparent backdrops
utilized to highlight personal information. 

Languages/tools utilized include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascipt, and JQuery.

Issues to return to: 
1) Responsiveness could be improved. 
2) There is always more styling!
3) Add more content to portfolio as more projects are completed.
